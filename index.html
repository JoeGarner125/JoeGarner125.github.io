Personal Information
</p>

<br>

<p class=p3 style="text-align: center">
  My name is Joseph Garner and I am a student studying IT at RMIT University (student number: s3808111). The email address to contact me, is <a href="mailto:josephgarner125@gmail.com">josephgarner125@gmail.com</a>.  I live in the Gippsland region of country Victoria, in Australia, and was raised in a family of 5 on a small property. In regard to my education to date, I studied yr10 Cambridge at school, then completed yr11 and left. I have completed a Certificate II of Security Operations and am currently also undergoing a Certificate III in Appliance Servicing at TAFE through a full-time apprenticeship.

<p class=p1>
Interest in IT
</p>

<br>

<p class=p3>
My interest in IT sparked quite recently actually. I don’t have an abundance of experience in IT up to now, so the way I got into IT, was through my interest in the Finance Industry. I have always had a brain for numbers and calculations, and this drove me to start a Finance Degree through Open Universities Online. In these studies, there is an IT component involved in the degree units. This unit in IT, has given me an understanding of the importance of IT in this day and age, but has also given me a drive to try and find potential ideas and projects that can be used as valuable tools in my future finance career.
</p>

<br>

<p class=p3>
I chose to come to RMIT simply for the credibility it has and the reviews from friends who have studied through the university before. The fact that RMIT is ranked in the top 250 universities is impressive even by itself. Then having close friends that have also studied through the same university that vouch for it, and have showed me the amount they have learned and how much they enjoyed the journey of being educated by RMIT. I am happy with my the decision I made, to study through RMIT so far. I have learned so much so far, while still only being in the early stages of my studies.
</p>

<br>

<p class=p3>
  In the rest of my studies through RMIT, via Open University, I am expecting to so much more. In this unit of Introduction to IT, I would love to understand more about how Information Technology will impact the Finance Industry in the future, and to be able to find useful tools in IT, that can assist me in working towards a successful career. Especially with finding tools I can use during the rest of my education at RMIT, to stream line my learning experience to learn more effectively.
</p>

<p class=p1>
  My Ideal Job
</p>

<br>

<p class=p3>
  With my passion of anything to do with numbers, my ideal job is to be a become a <i>financial advisor</i>. In order to get to this role, I will need to complete my <i>Bachelor or Business (Finance)</i>, and start my career at the rank of <i>Associate Advisor</i>. <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/39161698?searchrequesttoken=35de82d4-aa5f-43fb-87ec-f7bd94383a36&type=promoted">Here</a> is a link and screenshot of an advertised job, looking for an Associate Advisor on <b>seek.com.au</b>.
</p>

<br>
<!--add Associate Advisor immage here-->
<br>

<p class=p3>
This job would be the beginning of my journey in the industry. My role would be to support an experienced, leading advisor in achieving goals, and in the process learn more about the ins and outs of the large, complex industry through experience and mentorship. This role appeals to me, not only because it gives me a potentially very successful career path, but also because it would help me to handle my own money better, while giving me a current understand the economy and how to use it to my personal advantage. With getting experience through an Associate Advisory role, the next step is to aim for promotion to a lead advisory role, through hard work and loyalty to my employer. This will give me the opportunity to use my experience and knowledge gained through my course and training, to do the complete job of a Financial Advisor. From there, who knows what opportunities the future will hold for me. The aim for now though, is to exceed expectations in all areas of my studies, to give myself the best grounding to build my career on.

Personal Profile
</p>

<br>

<p class=p2>
Here are a few online tests I have completed and their results to give you a better understanding of my personality.
</p>

<br>

<p class=p3>
  1*  According to the Myer-Briggs test, done through <b>16personalities</b>, I am a Consul (ESFJ-A). A link to my result is provided
  <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/esfj-personality">Here</a>
</p>

<br>

<p class=p3>
  This means, I work well in a team and never compromise the end goal. I bring excitement and motivation to the team as well as drive and loyalty. I am a people person and find it easy to work with and deal with people in a tactful manner. Organisation is a large and important aspect I can incorporate into a team environment, to bring the effective system into my work for assisting in a successful outcome. I take responsibility extremely seriously, and pride myself on never missing a deadline or being late for anything. All these valuable traits, I practice in my everyday life, and will bring to any team environment I find myself in in the future.
</p>

<br>

<p class=p3>
2*  Completing a Learning Style Test online, has given me the following results that I will show as a percentage, to show how effective each method of learning is for me, 0% being not effective and 100% being most effective. All results and meanings stated below, can be found in <a href="https://www.learning-styles-online.com/inventory/results.php">here</a>.
</p>

<br>

<p class=p3>
  1	Visual – 60%
  (Using pictures, images and spatial understanding)
</p>

<br>

<p class=p3>
  2	Social – 80%
  (Using groups and others)
</p>

<br>

<p class=p3>
  3	Physical – 65%
  (Using sense of touch, hands or body)
</p>

<br>

<p class=p3>
  4	Aural – 80%
  (Using sound and music)
</p>

<br>

<p class=p3>
  5	Verbal – 55%
  (Using words, speech and writing)
</p>

<br>

<p class=p3>
  6	Solitary – 80%
  (Using self-study, working alone)
</p>

<br>

<p class=p3>
  7	Logical – 90%
  (Using logic, reasoning and systems)
</p>

<br>

<p class=p3>
These results mean I learn most effectively when using logic to figure things out. And also go to show I can learn just as well in a team environment as I can alone. Whether I am given a task to complete alone, or as a team, I can still learn and progress at the same rate either way.
</p>

<br>

<p class=p3>
  3*  The third test I have completed for my profile is the <i>Shelley Carson Creativity Test</i>, the link <a href="https://www.shelleycarson.com/creative-brain-test">here</a>.
</p>

<br>

<p class=p3>
This tests’ results show that the pathway I use to engage my creativity, is mostly through deliberately choosing to be creative, as opposed to spontaneously being creative. In other words, I don’t just suddenly become creative for no real need, I become creative when I need or want to be. I believe this can be helpful in a team environment, simply because some aspects in projects do need creativity, and when I need to be creative I can be. For example, if I was doing the HTML coding for the font of a website, I understand that I need to be creative, for the text to look captivating as I want it to be, so I can then become more creative to make sure I get a desired outcome.
</p>

<br>

<p class=p1>
Project Idea
</p>

<br>

<p class=p2>
Overview
</p>

<br>

<p class=p3>
  The project idea I am presenting, is called “Multi-Bank Terminal”.
  This is an application, currently in the idea stage, that would be a helpful utility for the everyday businessman, business owners, and would be especially helpful in the Finance industry. The app would be released in Australian only, to begin with. It will incorporate all the major banks’ online banking terminals in one, easy to use master terminal. This would enable people who are with multiple bank accounts with different banks to be able to access all their accounts from the same screen. This application will be made to be compatible for IOS and windows and will be available for Androids, Iphones, tablets, Ipads. It will also be free with in-app purchases.
</p>

<br>

<p class=p2>
Motivation
</p>

<br>

<p class=p3>
The finance industry has always been a large interest for me, and this gave me the idea to come up with this project idea. To simplify peoples online banking experience. I personally am a member with 2 separate banks, and it does get annoying having to constantly switch between the two applications to monitor my funds and transfers. Even if you are happy to switch between applications, it can be confusing having to adjust yourself to the layout of a totally different terminal. In our current times, to be successful in anything you do, time and concentration management is very important. If you have all you bank accounts, even if they are with different banks, in the same location using a simple, easy to work with terminal, you will save valuable time, and have a very valuable tool to make you want to do your budgeting. I know if this application was offered to me, I would jump at having an opportunity to simplify my online banking experience. This has the potential to be the next great application in the banking industry. It is a simple concept, but one with great potential.
</p>

<br>

<p class=p2>
Description
</p>

<br>

<p class=p3>
Just imagine, it comes to that time of your week when you do your budgeting, either business or personal, and you have the same daunting task ahead of having to jump all over your device to find all the apps and webpages you normally use to get it done. What would you say if there was an application that could potentially save you at least half the time it takes to achieve the very same task? This is exactly what myself and my team would be setting out to do. Our objective with “Multi-Bank Terminal” is to create a free, user friendly application, that allows users to access all their banking details and information from the very same spot. Who doesn’t like making their lives a little simpler, especially when it comes to regular, weekly tasks such as budgeting?
</p>

<br>

<p class=p3>
To log in to Multi-bank Terminal, we will use a multi lock system that has multiple stages of security. A passcode will be generated when first setting up the application, and it will be a randomly generated passcode the site will assign your profile. A number of personal security questions will be provided, and at least 3 must be answered and submitted upon set up of the app. When comes time to log in, the passcode provided to you during set up must be inputted, and 1 of your security questions at random will pop up and must be answered. This provides users with a high level of privacy and security for their banking details. Security would be the most important aspect of developing this application.
</p>

<br>

<p class=p3>
In Multi-Bank Terminal’s master terminal (homepage) it will have icons and names for each bank account you have inputted into the terminal, and they will be right in from of you, regardless of which corporation each account is with. There will be a tool bar along the top of the screen with all the different services the app provides. Such as a tutorial on how to get the most out of the terminal and information on what is provided for the users.
</p>

<br>

<p class=p3>
Multi-Bank Terminal’s job would primarily be to incorporate all major banks’ online banking terminals but would not be limited to this. We would also integrate with accounting firms around the country, on a commission-based understanding, to have a separate area in the app to offer local financial services anywhere near a desired location. Promotions of firms would be advertised in this section of the application, and there will be a comparison page as well, for users to compare costs, and reviews, to select the financial experts that best suit the job the user wants done. With this tool, online banking and the finance industry will be networked together, for the purpose of saving unnecessary time and effort, with all matters financial.
</p>

<br>

<p class=p2>
Tools and Technologies
</p>

<br>

<p class=p3>
I will be using Visual Studio, to develop and compile the app for Android and Apple devices. I would need up to date Android and Apple devices to test the app, even to the extent of tablets and Ipads, to make sure the formatting of the app is compatible with the dimensions of those devices as well.
</p>

<br>

<p class=p2>
Skills Required
</p>

<br>

<p class=p3>
To create this application, I will need a better understanding of JavaScript code and the  other relevant programming languages to create the app for android and IOS. I will also require an advanced working knowledge of Visual Studio.
</p>

<br>

<p class=p2>
Outcome
</p>

<br>

<p class=p3>
With the success of Multi-Bank Terminal, peoples lives will become that little bit less complicated. We will revolutionise the way online banking can be formatted, to help people to have a more positive experience. We plan to make a network for the Finance Industry, where people can choose to either do their own banking in one section of the app, or find local recommended Finance Professionals nearby to help them do the things they cant do. People who choose to use this app would not be paying a cent to access the full extent of our software. So, I believe this application will be a great hit once developed and published for the use of the public.
