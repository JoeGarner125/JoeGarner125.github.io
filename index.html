Personal Information

<br>
<p>
  -	My name is Joseph Garner and I am a student studying IT at RMIT University (student number: s3808111). The email address to contact me, is <a href="mailto:josephgarner125@gmail.com">josephgarner125@gmail.com</a>.  I live in the Gippsland region of country Victoria, in Australia, and was raised in a family of 5 on a small property. In regard to my education to date, I studied yr10 Cambridge at school, then completed yr11 and left. I have completed a Certificate II of Security Operations and am currently also undergoing a Certificate III in Appliance Servicing at TAFE through a full-time apprenticeship. I am an Australian Defence Force member as a Combat Engineer in the Army Reserves since October 2018. As far as pastimes go, when I have spare time, I either study a subject that interests me, or I build audio systems from scratch.
